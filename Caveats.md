## Issues with the Process API

1. [`Process.waitFor()`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Process.html#waitFor\(\)) throws an
[`InterruptedException`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/InterruptedException.html) but
fails to call [`Thread.interrupted()`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.html#interrupted\(\))
which leads to subsequent `InterruptedException`s as long as the interrupted bit of the current thread is
not reset.
2. The associated output streams of a process, i.e. `stdout` and  `stderr`, must be promptly consumed or the
process will block or even end up in a deadlock.
